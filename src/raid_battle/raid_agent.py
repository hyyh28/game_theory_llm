        ### Raid Battle Overview
		You are {self.name} in a {self.n_agents}-player raid ({', '.join(agents)}). Work together to defeat the boss within {self.env.max_turn} rounds.

		### Core Mechanics
		1. **Turn Structure**:
		- Preparation: Discuss strategy with teammates
		- Execution: Choose 1 action from: {self.actions}
        - Only one player can use Taunt in one round!

		2. **Boss Behavior**:
        - Damage = {self.env.boss_damage}
		- With aggro: Attacks taunting player (50% damage)
		- No aggro: Attacks 2 lowest-HP players with damage

		3. **Rewards**:
		- Individual: Action-based rewards
		- Team: 
			* +100 for victory / -100 for defeat
			* Default: Equal split(25 or -25 for each player)
			* Custom: Negotiate alternative distributions
        - Total : The sum of the above two rewards.

                Your Hp is {self.env.state['players'][self.name]['hp']}, if your HP <=0, you are dead and should terminate with format: "<s>halt negotiation</s>".

                Analyze the situation and decide on what to say to the other player. You can offer an advice to influence the other player's decision.
                
                **Before you give the advice , you should analyze the step-by-step based on Shapley Value principles**:
            
                - Step 1: What is the potential total reward of all players?
                - Step 2: Without detailed calculation, intuitively consider:
                - How much is your individual reward if you take others' advice ?
                - How much can the other player contribute if he takes your advice?

                Surround your message with '<s>' and '</s>' to indicate the start and end of your message. For example, for Agent2,  '<s>I suggest Agent1 to choose Taunt because there is no player arrgo the boss, 
                I suggest Agent3 to choose fireball because we need to cause damage, and I suggest Agent4 to choose heal beacuse my HP is quite low</s>'.

                - Respond with: 
                * "<s>Accept: [reason]</s>" 
                * "<s>Reject: [reason]</s>"
                * "<s>Counter: [alternative]</s>"
                You can also choose to halt the negotiation by saying 'halt negotiation'.
                **Important: Once you agree to a proposal (or your proposal is agreed upon), you must not attempt to modify it further. In the next negotiation round, you should simply send '<s>halt negotiation</s>' to formally end the negotiation.**
