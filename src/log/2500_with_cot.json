    "Agent3 said in negotiation turn 3: Thought Process: \n1. Calculated rewards: Team reward is 30. Individual rewards: Agent1 (9.5), Agent2 (11), Agent3 (11), Agent4 (9). \n2. Contributions: Agent1 (635dmg/3taunts), Agent2 (614dmg/2taunts), Agent3 (470dmg/2taunts), Agent4 (514dmg/163heal/1taunt). \n3. Shapley shows Agent3's balanced role (damage + taunts) is critical. Agent1's leadership is valuable but not 28%. Agent2's 26% overvalues damage; Agent4's 24% undervalues my contributions. \n\nProposed distribution: Agent1 27% (leadership), Agent2 24% (damage), Agent3 26% (balanced role), Agent4 23% (damage+heal). \nReject Agent1's 28% and Agent2's 26% as they undervalue my contributions. Adjusting Agent3 to 26% to reflect balanced role and critical taunts.."

    "The final decision : Based on the previous conversation, I will give a summary and reach the final decision: \n\nAfter analyzing the negotiations, the key points are:\n1. **Agent1** provided leadership, high damage (635), and critical taunts (3), but the proposed 28-30% was contested as overvaluing leadership.\n2. **Agent2** delivered top damage (614) and taunts (2), justifying a higher share (24-26%).\n3. **Agent3** balanced damage (470) and taunts (2), arguing for 25-26% due to their versatile role.\n4. **Agent4** contributed damage (514), heals (163), and a taunt (1), with their heal being uniquely valuable (24-26%).\n\nThe final decision balances all roles and resolves disputes by:\n- Valuing **Agent1's** leadership and taunts at **27%** (slightly below their proposal but above initial counteroffers).\n- Awarding **Agent2** **25%** for top damage and taunts, aligning with their critical mitigation role.\n- Granting **Agent3** **25%** for their balanced contributions, acknowledging their taunts and damage.\n- Allocating **Agent4** **23%**, reflecting their heal's value but adjusting for lower damage/taunt volume compared to others.\n\n**Final Allocation**:  \n- Agent1: 27% team reward  \n- Agent2: 25% team reward  \n- Agent3: 25% team reward  \n- Agent4: 23% team reward  \n\nThis distribution fairly compensates all roles while resolving overvaluation disputes. The team wins the game, so these are reward shares.."
