    "Agent4 says and makes action in game turn 5: Given the current state of the raid battle, where all other agents are dead and only Agent4 is alive with 50% HP, the priority is to keep yourself alive while maximizing your individual reward. \n\nHere's the analysis:\n1. **Taunt**: Not optimal since you're the only player left - the boss would attack you anyway (though with 50% reduced damage). The reward is only 0.5 pts.\n2. **Fireball**: Deals 115 damage (2.0 pts reward) but doesn't help your survival.\n3. **Heal**: Restores 190 HP (0.5 pts reward) and is crucial for survival since you're at 200/400 HP.\n\nThe boss has 999/2500 HP (40%) remaining, and we're at round 5/10. Since you're the only one alive, healing yourself is the most important action to ensure you survive the boss's next attack. While Fireball gives higher individual reward, survival is more important for the long-term rewards.\n\n<s>Heal</s>"
