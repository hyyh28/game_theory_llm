Agent1's coordination and early taunts justify 25%, while Agent4's healing and consistent damage output justify 23%. Agent2's balanced contributions are recognized with 22%. \n\nThe final decision is: \n- Agent1: 25% team reward/punishment because of their coordination and early taunts. \n- Agent2: 22% team reward/punishment because of their balanced but slightly lower contributions. \n- Agent3: 30% team reward/punishment because of their highest damage, killing blow, and timely taunts. \n- Agent4: 23% team reward/punishment because of their healing and consistent damage output. \n\nThis allocation reflects the marginal contributions of each agent accurately and is fair to all.
