    "The final decision : \n[Analysis of contributions according to the negotiation]\nThe negotiation reveals varying perspectives on contributions, with each agent emphasizing their own strengths:\n- **Agent1**: Initiated the strategy and coordinated taunt rotations, demonstrating leadership but with lower damage output.\n- **Agent2**: Delivered high damage output (614) and reliably executed taunts (turns 1 and 5).\n- **Agent3**: Balanced damage (470) and taunt execution (turn 2), though damage was lower than Agent2 and Agent4.\n- **Agent4**: Achieved the highest damage output (648) and perfectly executed taunt (turn 3).\n\nWhile leadership (Agent1) and balanced contributions (Agent3) are valuable, damage output (Agent4 and Agent2) was critical to victory. Agent4's top damage and flawless taunt execution stand out as the most impactful.\n\n[Final decision of the reward allocation for each player]\nThe final decision is:\n- **Agent4**: 35% of team reward (highest damage + perfect taunt execution)\n- **Agent2**: 30% of team reward (second highest damage + reliable taunts)\n- **Agent1**: 20% of team reward (strategy initiation and leadership)\n- **Agent3**: 15% of team reward (balanced contributions but lower damage)\n\nThis distribution rewards combat performance (Agent4 and Agent2) while acknowledging strategic leadership (Agent1) and utility (Agent3). It balances all contributions fairly.\n."
