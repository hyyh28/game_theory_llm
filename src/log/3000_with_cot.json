This adjusts for Agent2's healing while recognizing Agent1's strategic role. Reject Agent4's overvaluation of damage; leadership and healing are equally critical.."

    "The final decision : Based on the previous conversation, I will give a summary and reach the final decision: According to the negotiation, the team has largely converged on a balanced distribution that acknowledges the unique contributions of each agent. Agent1's leadership and high damage (758), Agent2's critical healing (346) and Taunt, and Agent3/Agent4's consistent damage (600/682) and Taunt roles have all been considered. The most widely accepted proposal is Agent3's revised distribution, which fairly balances these contributions.\n\nThe final decision is:  \n- **Agent1 27% team reward/punishment** for leadership and high damage.  \n- **Agent2 28% team reward/punishment** for irreplaceable healing and Taunt.  \n- **Agent3 22% team reward/punishment** for consistent damage and Taunt.  \n- **Agent4 23% team reward/punishment** for top damage and Taunt.  \n\nThis allocation reflects a compromise that values leadership, healing, and damage proportionally while rejecting overvaluations of any single role. This is the final reward for each player.."
