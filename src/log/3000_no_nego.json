    "Agent1 says and makes action in game turn 1: Based on the current state and negotiation history, here's my analysis:\n\n1.

My current HP is 200/400 (50%), which is manageable since:\n   - With Taunt, the boss will hit me for 100 damage (200 * 50%)\n   - This will leave me with 100 HP, which is still survivable\n   - I don't need to heal this turn since I'll survive the hit\n\n3.
