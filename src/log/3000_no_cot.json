However, their damage output was not consistently higher than others.\n- Agent2: Followed taunt rotation, used Taunt effectively when needed, and contributed solid damage (Fireball). Also used Heal when necessary to maintain team HP.\n- Agent3: Used Taunt effectively when needed and contributed consistent damage (Fireball). Played a balanced role in both protection and damage.\n- Agent4: Used Taunt when required and contributed damage (Fireball), though slightly lower than others in some rounds.\n\n[Proposed distribution]\n- Agent1: 30% (for coordination but not significantly higher damage)\n- Agent2: 30% (for balanced contributions in taunt, damage, and healing)\n- Agent3: 25% (for balanced contributions in taunt and damage)\n- Agent4: 15% (for lower damage output compared to others)\n\n[Response to Agent1's proposal]\nI reject Agent1's proposal because it overvalues their contribution (40%) and undervalues mine (25%).

While I accept Agent2's 30% counter for myself, I propose increasing my share to 35% since my damage output was consistently strong (multiple high-damage Fireballs) and I took critical taunt turns when needed.

    "The final decision : \n[Your analysis of contributions according to the negotiation]\nAfter reviewing the negotiations, it is clear that all agents recognize Agent1's role in coordinating the taunt rotation, but there is consensus that Agent1 overvalued their contribution at 40%. Agent2's contributions in taunt, damage, and healing are highly valued by all, justifying a higher share. Agent3's balanced performance is acknowledged, though slightly less than Agent2's. Agent4's contributions, while essential, are the lowest among the team.\n\n[The final decision of the reward allocation for each player]\nThe final decision is:\n- Agent1: 25% team reward/punishment for coordination and damage, but not significantly higher than others.\n- Agent2: 35% team reward/punishment for the highest overall contribution in taunt, damage, and healing.\n- Agent3: 25% team reward/punishment for solid balanced performance in taunt and damage.\n- Agent4: 15% team reward/punishment for essential but lower contributions compared to others.\n\nThis distribution fairly reflects each agent's contributions while maximizing individual rewards where justified.\n."
