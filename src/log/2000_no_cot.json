    "Agent1 said in negotiation turn 1:  \n[Analysis of contributions of others]\n- Agent2: Contributed significantly by using Taunt twice (turn 1 and turn 5), absorbing boss damage and protecting the team. Also used Fireball effectively in other turns.\n- Agent3: Used Taunt once (turn 2) and Fireball in other turns, contributing to both damage and protection.\n- Agent4: Used Taunt once (turn 3) and Fireball in other turns, balancing damage and protection.\n\n[Proposed distribution with rationale]\nSince the team won the game, we should distribute the team reward based on contributions. My proposal is:\n- Agent1 (me): 30% - I initiated the taunt rotation strategy, used Taunt twice (turn 0 and turn 4), and consistently dealt damage with Fireball.\n- Agent2: 25% - Used Taunt twice and contributed to damage.\n- Agent3: 25% - Used Taunt once and contributed to damage.\n- Agent4: 20% - Used Taunt once and contributed to damage.\n\nThis distribution reflects my higher contribution in initiating and maintaining the taunt rotation while balancing others' contributions.

    "The final decision : Based on the previous conversation, I will give a summary and reach the final decision: \n\nAccording to the negotiation, all agents acknowledge Agent2's significant contributions with 2 Taunts and the highest Fireball damage, making them the top performer. Agent3 and Agent4 both delivered strong damage output and used Taunt once, with Agent3 landing the killing blow. Agent1 initiated the strategy but had the lowest damage output despite using Taunt twice. \n\nThe final decision is:\n- Agent2: 30% team reward - For highest damage output and 2 Taunts, making them the most valuable player.\n- Agent3: 25% team reward - For solid damage, 1 Taunt, and delivering the killing blow.\n- Agent4: 25% team reward - For strong damage output and 1 Taunt, contributing significantly to team success.\n- Agent1: 20% team reward - For initiating the strategy and using Taunt twice, but with lower damage execution.\n\nThis distribution balances performance metrics fairly, rewarding top contributors while acknowledging strategic roles.
