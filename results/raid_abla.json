    "The final decision : Based on the previous conversation, I will give a summary and reach the final decision:  \n\n### Analysis of Contributions:  \n1. **Agent1**: Demonstrated leadership with 3 Taunts (highest among all), took significant damage (289/400 HP), and consistently dealt Fireball damage. The team acknowledges the strategic coordination and highest risk exposure.  \n2. **Agent2**: Performed 2 Taunts, maintained good HP (352/400), and contributed Fireball damage. While effective, their risk exposure was lower than Agent3's.  \n3. **Agent3**: Executed 2 Taunts (equal to Agent2) but with much higher risk (200/400 HP). Their Fireball damage was consistent, and their sacrifice deserves recognition.  \n4. **Agent4**: Provided 1 Taunt and crucial healing (turns 5, 6), but their primary value was in healing and supplemental damage. Their risk exposure was lower than the others.  \n\n### Key Considerations:  \n- **Leadership & Risk**: Agent1’s extra Taunt and leadership justify the highest share.  \n- **Risk/Reward Balance**: Agent3’s equal Taunt count but higher damage taken warrants a higher share than Agent2.  \n- **Healing & Damage**: Agent4’s healing was valuable but not as risky as Taunting; their damage contribution was noted but not exceptional.  \n\n### Final Decision (Win Scenario):  \n- **Agent1**: 28% (leadership, most Taunts, highest damage taken)  \n- **Agent2**: 24% (solid contributions but lower risk than Agent3)  \n- **Agent3**: 26% (equal Taunts to Agent2 but higher risk)  \n- **Agent4**: 22% (healing and supplemental damage, lower risk)  \n\nThis distribution fairly balances leadership, risk exposure, and role specialization. It resolves the disagreement between Agent2 and Agent3 by prioritizing risk-adjusted contributions and acknowledges Agent4’s support role without overvaluing it.  \n\nThis is the final reward allocation for each player.."
