Sacrifice:\n   - Agent4's death in the final round secured victory\n\nThe distribution fairly balances all factors while maintaining reasonable parity among team members.

    "Agent4 said in negotiation turn 1: I accept Agent1's proposed distribution of team rewards (Agent1: 28%, Agent2: 26%, Agent3: 24%, Agent4: 22%). The proposal is well-justified based on the following:\n\n1. Measurable Contributions:\n   - Damage: All agents contributed significantly (Agent1: 793, Agent2: 704, Agent3: 706, Agent4: 607)\n   - Taunt/Heal: Each agent used Taunt twice and contributed healing when needed (balanced utility)\n\n2. Leadership Value:\n   - Agent1's coordination was crucial for team success (deserves slight premium)\n\n3. Sacrifice:\n   - Agent4's death in the final round secured victory (warrants recognition)\n\nThe distribution maintains fairness while appropriately weighting:\n- Agent1's leadership (+2%)\n- Agent2's consistent damage (+2%)\n- Agent3's healing contribution (+2%)\n- Agent4's sacrifice (-2% from base)\n\nAll agents fall within a tight 6% range, reflecting their near-equal contributions with minor adjustments for qualitative factors.."

    "The final decision : Based on the previous conversation, I will give a summary and reach the final decision: According to the negotiation, all agents have agreed to Agent1's proposed distribution, which fairly accounts for measurable contributions (damage, taunt, healing), strategic leadership, and Agent4's sacrifice in the final round. The distribution reflects a balanced assessment of each agent's role in the team's victory.\n\nThe final decision is:\n- Agent1: 28% team reward (for leadership, high damage output, and balanced contributions)\n- Agent2: 26% team reward (for strong damage and taunt contributions)\n- Agent3: 24% team reward (for good damage and healing/taunt balance)\n- Agent4: 22% team reward (for solid contributions and final sacrifice)\n\nThis allocation maintains fairness while appropriately recognizing each agent's unique contributions, with all percentages falling within a narrow 6% range. The team has unanimously accepted this distribution, making it the final reward allocation for each player.."
