Agent2 and Agent4 also had significant contributions, while Agent1's early taunt and low damage were deemed less impactful.  \n\nThe final decision is:  \n- **Agent3 (10% team punishment)**: Highest marginal impact with top damage, healing, and taunt absorption.  \n- **Agent2 (20% team punishment)**: Critical healing and substantial damage.  \n- **Agent4 (20% team punishment)**: Strong damage and taunt, with some healing.  \n- **Agent1 (50% team punishment)**: Early taunt and low damage, died quickly.  \n\nThis allocation reflects the true marginal contributions of each player.
