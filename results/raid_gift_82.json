The split accurately reflects Shapley Value principles by valuing tank/healer roles (Agent1/Agent2) for enabling team success and distinguishing damage contributions (Agent4 > Agent3).

The split fairly accounts for role importance (tank/healer) and marginal damage contributions, with Agent4’s higher output justifying their slight edge over me. No adjustments needed.."

This better reflects Shapley Value by accounting for Agent4's marginal damage advantage over Agent3 while preserving role weights. I can justify further if needed.."

    "The final decision : Based on the previous conversation, I will give a summary and reach the final decision: According to the negotiation, the team largely agrees on the importance of tank/healer roles (Agent1 and Agent2) and acknowledges the marginal damage contributions of Agent4 over Agent3. While Agent1, Agent2, and Agent3 initially agreed on a 30%/30%/20%/20% split, Agent4 proposed a slight adjustment to 30%/30%/15%/25% to better reflect their higher damage output. Given that Agent4's proposal still preserves the core weighting of roles and aligns with Shapley Value principles by accounting for marginal contributions, it is a reasonable compromise.  \n\nThe final decision is:  \n- **Agent1: 30% team reward/punishment** due to taunt, damage, and critical risk-taking.  \n- **Agent2: 30% team reward/punishment** due to healing, damage, and survival under heavy damage.  \n- **Agent3: 15% team reward/punishment** for consistent but slightly lower damage output.  \n- **Agent4: 25% team reward/punishment** for the highest damage contribution.  \n\nThis allocation balances role importance and marginal contributions while addressing Agent4's justified request. This is the final reward for each player.."
