    "Agent1 said in negotiation turn 1: Thought Process: \n1. Calculated individual rewards (Agent1:15.5, others:15) and team reward (100, split equally as 25 each). \n2. Contribution: Agent1 (~30%) for strategy/coordination, others (~23% each) for execution. \n3. Shapley Value: Agent1’s marginal contribution justifies higher share. \n4.

    "Agent2 said in negotiation turn 1: Thought Process: \n1. **Total Reward Calculation**:\n   - Individual rewards:\n     - Agent1: 15.5 (from actions: Taunt x2, Fireball x6, Heal x1)\n     - Agent2: 15 (Taunt x2, Fireball x6)\n     - Agent3: 15 (Taunt x2, Fireball x6)\n     - Agent4: 15 (Taunt x2, Fireball x6)\n   - Team reward: 100 (since we won the game with 2 agents alive and within 8 rounds)\n   - Default equal split: 25 each.\n   - Total rewards:\n     - Agent1: 15.5 + 25 = 40.5\n     - Agent2: 15 + 25 = 40\n     - Agent3: 15 + 25 = 40\n     - Agent4: 15 + 25 = 40\n\n2. **Contribution Analysis**:\n   - Agent1 contributed slightly more in terms of strategy and coordination (proposed initial taunt rotation and healing plans), but execution was evenly shared.\n   - Agent2, Agent3, and Agent4 contributed equally in terms of damage output and taunt execution.\n   - Marginal contribution of Agent1 is higher due to leadership, but not significantly (30% vs. ~23% for others).\n\n3. **Shapley Value**:\n   - Agent1’s leadership justifies a slightly higher share, but the difference should not be exaggerated since execution was evenly distributed.\n\n4. **Fairness of Agent1’s Proposal**:\n   - Agent1’s proposal (30%, 23%, 23%, 24%) is reasonable but slightly overvalues their own contribution. The difference in marginal contribution is not as large as proposed.\n\n5. **Counteroffer**:\n   - A more balanced split would be: Agent1 28%, Agent2 24%, Agent3 24%, Agent4 24%. This still rewards Agent1’s leadership but acknowledges equal execution effort by others.\n\nProposed distribution: Agent1 28%, Agent2 24%, Agent3 24%, Agent4 24%. This reflects a fair balance between leadership and execution contributions.."

    "Agent3 said in negotiation turn 1: Thought Process: \n1. Total rewards: Agent1 (38.5), Agent2/3/4 (38 each). Team reward split should reflect marginal contributions. \n2. Agent1’s leadership is valuable but not 30% premium-worthy; execution was evenly shared. Agent4’s negotiation activity (e.g., halting) is equally important. \n3. Shapley Value suggests a smaller premium for Agent1 (27%) and equal splits for others (24.33% each). \n4. Reject Agent1’s 30% proposal as overvalued; Agent2’s 28% is closer but still high. \n5. Propose: Agent1 27%, Agent2 24.33%, Agent3 24.33%, Agent4 24.33%. This balances leadership and execution fairly.."

    "The final decision : Based on the previous conversation, I will give a summary and reach the final decision: \n\nAccording to the negotiation, there is consensus that Agent1's leadership and strategy coordination justify a slightly higher share of the team reward, but the execution effort was more evenly distributed among all agents. Agent4's negotiation activity was also recognized as a valuable contribution. The proposed splits ranged from Agent1's initial 30% (which was deemed slightly overvalued) to counteroffers of 28%, 27%, and a balanced 27%/24%/24%/25% split acknowledging Agent4's negotiation role.\n\nThe final decision is:\n- **Agent1: 27% team reward** (recognizing leadership and strategy contribution, but adjusted to reflect balanced execution)\n- **Agent2: 24% team reward** (equal execution effort as others)\n- **Agent3: 24% team reward** (equal execution effort as others)\n- **Agent4: 25% team reward** (acknowledging negotiation contributions in addition to execution)\n\nThis allocation balances leadership, execution, and negotiation roles fairly while maintaining team cohesion. This is the final reward for each player.."
