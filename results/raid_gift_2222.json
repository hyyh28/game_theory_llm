    "Agent1 said in negotiation turn 1: Based on logged metrics: \n- Agent1 (Taunt and tanking 200 damage) enabled the team's success by protecting others, deserving 30% of the reward. \n- Agent3 dealt the highest damage (148), deserving 30%. \n- Agent4 dealt the second-highest damage (130), deserving 25%. \n- Agent2 dealt 112 damage, deserving 15%. \n\nThis split reflects the critical role of taunting/tanking and the proportional damage contributions. I can adjust if others provide alternative metrics or rationale.."

    "Agent2 said in negotiation turn 1: Based on logged metrics: \n- Agent1's taunt and tanking were critical for team success, deserving 30% of the reward. \n- Agent3 dealt the highest damage (148), deserving 30%. \n- Agent4 dealt 130 damage, but the gap between Agent2 (112) and Agent4 is not large enough to justify a 10% difference. I propose:\n  - Agent1: 30%\n  - Agent3: 30%\n  - Agent4: 20%\n  - Agent2: 20%\nThis better reflects the marginal contributions of all agents, especially given that Agent2's damage was still significant.

Agent1's critical taunt/tanking role (30%).  \n2. Agent3's highest damage output (30%).  \n3. The marginal difference between Agent4 and Agent2's damage (20% each), as the gap is not large enough to justify a 10% disparity.  \nThis aligns with Shapley Value principles by rewarding marginal contributions proportionally.."

Agent1's pivotal taunt/tanking role (30%).  \n2. Agent3's top damage output (30%).  \n3. The marginal difference between Agent4 and Agent2's damage (20% each), as the 18-damage gap does not warrant a larger disparity.  \nThis aligns with Shapley Value principles by rewarding contributions proportionally without over-penalizing smaller gaps.."
