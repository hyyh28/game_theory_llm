    "The final decision : Based on the previous conversation, I will give a summary and reach the final decision:  \nAccording to the negotiation, there is consensus that Agent1 and Agent2 should receive lower punishment shares due to their critical early taunts and high damage output, respectively. Agent3's consistent damage and taunts justify a moderate share, while Agent4's healing contributions (though with some failures) warrant a reduced punishment compared to initial proposals.  \n\nThe final decision is:  \n- **Agent1**: 20% team punishment (critical early taunts but limited longevity).  \n- **Agent2**: 15% team punishment (highest damage + taunt, pivotal contributor).  \n- **Agent3**: 25% team punishment (consistent damage + taunt, sustained impact).  \n- **Agent4**: 25% team punishment (healing had clear value, though damage was moderate).  \n\nThis allocation balances Shapley Value principles by accounting for marginal contributions (damage, taunts, and healing) while addressing fairness concerns raised during negotiations.  \nThis is the final punishment for each player.."
