    "The final decision : Based on the previous conversation, I will give a summary and reach the final decision:  \nAccording to the negotiation, the key points of contention revolve around the valuation of taunt utility, healing, and pure damage roles. Agent1 and Agent2 provided taunt utility, with Agent1 using it more frequently (3 taunts vs. Agent2’s 1), while Agent4 contributed healing alongside damage. Agent3’s pure damage was acknowledged as consistent but replaceable. The Shapley Value adjustments highlight the higher marginal impact of taunt and healing roles compared to pure damage.  \n\nAfter evaluating the proposals:  \n- Agent1’s 25% baseline for taunt utility is reasonable but slightly undervalues their consistent taunts.  \n- Agent2’s 30% claim is excessive given their single taunt, but their damage output justifies a higher share than Agent3.  \n- Agent3’s 22% proposal overvalues their replaceable role, while Agent4’s healing justifies a share above Agent3.  \n\n**Final Decision**:  \n- **Agent1**: 27% team reward/punishment (critical taunts + damage).  \n- **Agent2**: 28% team reward/punishment (highest damage + situational taunt).  \n- **Agent3**: 20% team reward/punishment (consistent but replaceable damage).  \n- **Agent4**: 25% team reward/punishment (healing + damage).  \n\nThis distribution balances marginal contributions fairly, accounting for role criticality and situational impact.  \nThis is the final reward for each player.."
