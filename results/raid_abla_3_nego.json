    "Agent1 says and makes action in game turn 5: Based on the current state and negotiation history, here's my analysis:\n\n1. Agent3 has declared they will Taunt this round, which means the boss will target them with reduced damage (100 instead of 200). This is good for team survival.\n\n2. Agent4 is at the lowest HP (200/400) and has declared they will Heal themselves, which is appropriate.\n\n3. My HP is at 300/400 (75%), which is safe for now.\n\n4. The boss has only 540/2500 HP remaining (21.6%), so dealing damage is important to finish the fight quickly.\n\n5. Fireball gives the highest individual reward (2.0 pts) and helps defeat the boss faster.\n\nSince my HP is decent and someone else is handling taunting/healing, I'll choose:\n<s>Fireball</s>"
