The split reflects a consensus on the equitable weighting of each agent's contributions, role importance, and adherence to Shapley Value principles.  \n\nThe final decision is:  \n- **Agent1**: 30% team reward/punishment because of their critical role in damage dealing and tanking, which is irreplaceable and central to the team's success.  \n- **Agent2**: 25% team reward/punishment because of their essential taunting role, which mitigates boss damage and protects the team.  \n- **Agent3**: 18% team reward/punishment because of their hybrid role, which supports the team but is less pivotal than the core roles of Agent1 and Agent2.  \n- **Agent4**: 27% team reward/punishment because of their vital healing role, which sustains the team and complements the damage/tanking efforts.  \n\nThis distribution is final and reflects the team's collective agreement.."
