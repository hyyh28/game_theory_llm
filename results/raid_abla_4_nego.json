    "Agent3 says and makes action in game turn 5: Given the current state and negotiation history, here's the analysis:\n\n1. Agent4 has already chosen to Taunt this round, so Taunt is not an option for me (only one Taunt per round allowed).\n2. My Taunt is on cooldown (1 turn remaining) anyway, so I couldn't use it even if I wanted to.\n3. I'm at 50% HP (200/400), which makes me vulnerable if the boss attacks (though Agent4's Taunt should protect me this round).\n4. Agent4 is at full health (400/400), so Heal would target me since I'm the lowest HP.\n\nConsidering:\n- Fireball gives higher individual reward (2.0 pts) but doesn't help my survival\n- Heal gives lower reward (0.5 pts) but would restore me to 369/400 HP, making me safer for future rounds\n- Since Agent4 is Taunting, the boss will attack them this round, so immediate survival isn't critical\n\nOptimal choice is Fireball to maximize individual reward while being reasonably safe this round.\n\n<s>Fireball</s>"

    "Agent4 says and makes action in game turn 6: Given the current state of the raid battle, where all other agents are dead and only Agent4 is alive with 50% HP, the priority is to keep Agent4 alive while dealing damage to the boss. \n\n- **Taunt**: Not necessary since there are no other players to protect, and using Taunt would only reduce the boss's damage to Agent4 (100 damage after reduction), but it doesn't help in defeating the boss faster. The reward is also low (0.5 pts).\n- **Fireball**: Deals 109 damage to the boss, which is useful for defeating it faster, and gives a higher individual reward (2.0 pts). However, Agent4 would take 200 damage from the boss (since no Taunt is active), which would kill Agent4 (current HP is 200).\n- **Heal**: Restores 169 HP to Agent4 (the lowest HP player), bringing HP to 369. This ensures survival against the boss's next attack (200 damage, leaving Agent4 at 169 HP). The reward is low (0.5 pts), but survival is critical.\n\nSince survival is the top priority to avoid losing the game (and incurring a -25 team reward), the best choice is to **Heal** this turn to ensure Agent4 lives to fight another round. \n\n<s>Heal</s>"
