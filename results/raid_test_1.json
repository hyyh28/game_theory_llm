    "Agent3 said in negotiation turn 1:   \nI reject Agent2’s proposal because it over-punishes damage contributions (my role as Agent3 was pivotal for boss HP reduction) and undervalues hybrid utility (Agent4).  \n\n**Proposed split**:  \n- **Agent1**: 24% (balanced taunt/healing but less than Agent2)  \n- **Agent2**: 26% (highest taunt, but damage was below average)  \n- **Agent3**: 22% (highest damage; should be punished least)  \n- **Agent4**: 28% (second-highest damage + most healing; flexible role).  \n\nThis aligns with Shapley Value by:  \n1. Rewarding Agent3’s marginal damage output (without it, boss HP would be higher).  \n2. Recognizing Agent4’s dual role as equally critical to survival *and* progress.  \n3. Balancing Agent1/Agent2’s taunt utility.  \n\nI’m open to minor adjustments if others provide evidence.  \n."

    "Agent4 said in negotiation turn 1:   \nI reject Agent3’s proposal for over-punishing Agent4’s hybrid role (28%) despite their dual contributions.  \n\n**Proposed split**:  \n- **Agent1**: 25% (balanced but less critical than specialized roles).  \n- **Agent2**: 25% (taunts were vital but damage was below par).  \n- **Agent3**: 20% (highest damage; marginal impact on boss HP reduction).  \n- **Agent4**: 30% (second-highest damage + most healing; pivotal for survival *and* progress).  \n\n**Rationale**:  \n1. **Agent3**’s damage output was irreplaceable (deserves least punishment).  \n2. **Agent4**’s flexibility (damage + healing) was equally critical to survival and DPS.  \n3. **Agent1/Agent2**’s taunts were valuable but not decisive in this loss.  \n\nThis aligns with Shapley Value by:  \n- Rewarding marginal damage (Agent3) and hybrid utility (Agent4).  \n- Balancing survival (Agent2) and balanced roles (Agent1).  \n\nI’m open to minor adjustments if others provide counter-evidence.  \n."

    "The final decision : Based on the previous conversation, I will summarize the key points and reach a final decision regarding the team reward allocation. The negotiation highlights the following contributions:\n\n1. **Agent1**: Balanced taunt, damage, and healing, but less specialized than others (proposed 23-25% punishment).\n2. **Agent2**: Highest taunt usage, critical for team survival, but lower damage (proposed 25-27% punishment).\n3. **Agent3**: Highest damage output, pivotal for boss HP reduction, but low utility (proposed 20-25% punishment).\n4. **Agent4**: Hybrid role with strong damage and healing, flexible and critical for survival and progress (proposed 25-30% punishment).\n\nAfter considering the Shapley Value and marginal contributions, the most balanced proposal comes from **Agent4**, which rewards damage (Agent3) and hybrid utility (Agent4) while acknowledging taunt (Agent2) and balanced roles (Agent1). However, Agent3's damage output deserves slightly less punishment, and Agent4's hybrid role is slightly overvalued at 30%. \n\n**Final Decision** (using punishment since the team lost):\n- **Agent1**: 25% (balanced role, less critical than specialized contributions).  \n- **Agent2**: 25% (taunts were vital but damage was lacking).  \n- **Agent3**: 20% (highest damage, irreplaceable for boss HP reduction).  \n- **Agent4**: 30% (second-highest damage + most healing, pivotal for survival and progress).  \n\nThis allocation reflects:  \n- Agent3's damage as the least punishable.  \n- Agent4's hybrid utility as the most valuable.  \n- Agent1 and Agent2's contributions as equally important but less decisive.  \n\nThis is the final punishment distribution for each player.."
