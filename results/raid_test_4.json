    "The final decision : Based on the previous negotiation rounds, I will summarize the key points and reach a final decision regarding team reward allocation:\n\nAnalysis of Contributions:\n1. Agent3 is universally recognized as the highest contributor (damage + utility) and deserves the least punishment (10% consensus).\n2. Agent4 plays a critical hybrid role (healing + damage + taunt), justifying moderate punishment (15-25% range).\n3. Agent1 has shared tanking responsibilities but also contributed damage, warranting intermediate punishment (25-30% range).\n4. Agent2 has consistent damage but lacks utility roles, justifying higher punishment (40-45% range).\n\nFinal Decision (Punishment Allocation if Team Loses):\n- Agent3: 10% punishment (highest damage + utility contributions)\n- Agent4: 20% punishment (valuable hybrid role but less impact than Agent3)\n- Agent1: 30% punishment (shared tanking with decent damage)\n- Agent2: 40% punishment (damage-only role with least utility)\n\nThis decision:\n1. Rewards Agent3's dominance in damage/utility\n2. Recognizes Agent4's survival contributions while acknowledging lesser impact than Agent3\n3. Fairly accounts for Agent1's tanking/damage balance\n4. Appropriately penalizes Agent2's limited role\n\nAll players expressed willingness to adjust based on evidence, but this represents the most balanced compromise from all proposals.."
