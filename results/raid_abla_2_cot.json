    "Agent2 said in negotiation turn 1:  \nAnalysis of contributions:\n- Agent1: Demonstrated strong leadership by proposing effective strategies and coordinating the team. Used Taunt twice and contributed significant damage with Fireball.\n- Agent2: Used Taunt twice and consistently followed strategies, contributing to both team protection (Taunt) and damage output (Fireball). Played a balanced role in the team's success.\n- Agent3: Used Taunt twice and consistently dealt high damage with Fireball, excelling in both offense and defense. A key contributor to the team's victory.\n- Agent4: Provided crucial healing at critical moments, ensuring team survival, and followed strategies effectively. Played a vital support role.\n\nProposed distribution (since the team won the game):\n- Agent1: 25% of team reward for leadership and balanced contributions.\n- Agent2: 25% of team reward for reliable taunting and damage, as my contributions were equally valuable.\n- Agent3: 30% of team reward for high damage output and taunting.\n- Agent4: 20% of team reward for vital healing support.\n\nThis adjustment reflects a more balanced recognition of Agent2's contributions, which were on par with Agent1's in terms of Taunt usage and damage output, while still acknowledging Agent1's leadership and Agent3's high damage. Agent4's healing remains critical but slightly less weighted given the offensive focus of the game. \n."

    "Agent3 said in negotiation turn 1: Analysis of contributions:\n- Agent1: Demonstrated strong leadership by proposing effective strategies and coordinating the team. Used Taunt twice and contributed significant damage with Fireball.\n- Agent2: Used Taunt twice and consistently followed strategies, contributing to both team protection (Taunt) and damage output (Fireball). Played a balanced role in the team's success.\n- Agent3: Used Taunt twice and consistently dealt the highest damage with Fireball (total damage output highest among all agents), excelling in both offense and defense. A key contributor to the team's victory.\n- Agent4: Provided crucial healing at critical moments, ensuring team survival, and followed strategies effectively. Played a vital support role but had the lowest damage output.\n\nProposed distribution (since the team won the game):\n- Agent1: 25% of team reward for leadership and balanced contributions.\n- Agent2: 20% of team reward for reliable taunting and damage.\n- Agent3: 35% of team reward for highest damage output and taunting.\n- Agent4: 20% of team reward for vital healing support.\n\nThis proposal better reflects the actual damage contributions while maintaining fair recognition for leadership and support roles. Agent3 deserves the highest share due to consistently dealing the most damage (142+150+148+102+129+126 = 797 total damage) while also taunting twice. I reject Agent2's proposal to equalize their share with Agent1 since Agent1's strategic leadership provided more value to the team's success.."

    "Agent4 said in negotiation turn 1: Analysis of contributions:\n- Agent1: Demonstrated strong leadership and strategy coordination, used Taunt twice, and dealt significant Fireball damage. Key to team success.\n- Agent2: Reliable Taunt usage (twice) and consistent Fireball damage, but less strategic input than Agent1.\n- Agent3: Highest damage output (797 total) and two Taunts, making them the MVP in both offense and defense.\n- Agent4: Critical healing support but lowest damage contribution (only 3 Fireballs vs others' 5-6).\n\nProposed distribution (team won):\n- Agent1: 25% (leadership + balanced contributions)\n- Agent2: 15% (solid but replaceable role)\n- Agent3: 40% (MVP-level damage + Taunts)\n- Agent4: 20% (essential healing)\n\nI reject Agent3's 35% proposal as undervaluing their damage dominance (30% higher than next agent), and Agent2's 25% claim as inflated. My 40% for Agent3 reflects their irreplaceable impact, while maintaining fairness for others' roles.."

    "The final decision : Based on the previous conversation, I will give a summary and reach the final decision: \n\nAnalysis of contributions according to the negotiation:\n- **Agent1** demonstrated strong leadership, strategic coordination, and balanced contributions (2 Taunts + significant Fireball damage). Their role was pivotal in guiding the team.\n- **Agent2** was reliable in Taunt usage (2 Taunts) and consistent Fireball damage, but their strategic input was less impactful than Agent1's.\n- **Agent3** was the MVP, dealing the highest damage (797 total) and using 2 Taunts, excelling in both offense and defense. Their contributions were irreplaceable.\n- **Agent4** provided critical healing support but had the lowest damage output, playing a vital but more specialized role.\n\nFinal decision for team reward allocation (since the team won the game):\n- **Agent1**: 25% of team reward for leadership and balanced contributions.\n- **Agent2**: 15% of team reward for reliable but less unique contributions compared to others.\n- **Agent3**: 40% of team reward for MVP-level damage and defensive efforts.\n- **Agent4**: 20% of team reward for essential healing support.\n\nThis distribution reflects the actual impact of each agent, with Agent3 receiving the highest share due to their unmatched damage output and Taunt usage, while fairly recognizing Agent1's leadership and Agent4's healing. Agent2's share is adjusted downward slightly given their more replaceable role compared to the others.."
