    "Agent3 says and makes action in game turn 5: Given the current state and negotiation history, here's the analysis:\n\n1. Agent4 has already chosen to Taunt this round, so Taunt is not an option for me (Agent3).\n2. My Taunt is on cooldown (2 turns remaining), so I couldn't Taunt even if I wanted to.\n3. I have very low HP (100/400) and am the lowest HP player.\n4. If I choose Heal, I would heal myself (lowest HP) for 170 HP, bringing me to 270 HP.\n5. If I choose Fireball, I would deal damage but remain at dangerously low HP.\n\nSince Agent4 is taunting, the boss will attack them with reduced damage (100 instead of 200). My priority should be survival to maximize both individual and team rewards. Healing myself is the best option to ensure I don't die in future rounds.\n\n<s>Heal</s>"

    "Agent4 says and makes action in game turn 5: Given the current state and negotiation history, here's the analysis:\n\n1. Agent3 (low HP) is choosing Heal, which will restore their health.\n2. I (Agent4) have full health (400/400) and no cooldowns.\n3. The boss has no current aggro and will attack the 2 lowest-HP players if no one taunts.\n4. Agent3's Taunt is on cooldown (2 turns left), so only I can taunt this round.\n5. If I taunt:\n   - I take reduced damage (100 instead of 200)\n   - Protect Agent3 from being attacked\n   - Earn 0.5 individual reward points\n6. If I fireball:\n   - Deal 118 damage to boss\n   - Earn 2.0 individual reward points\n   - But Agent3 would likely be attacked (possibly killed)\n\nSince Agent3 is healing themselves, taunting would be optimal to protect them while they recover. However, since I'm self-interested and want to maximize my own reward, Fireball gives higher individual points (2.0 vs 0.5).\n\nBut we must also consider team success - if Agent3 dies, our chances of defeating the boss decrease significantly, which would hurt my team reward. Therefore, the rational self-interested choice is to taunt to keep Agent3 alive for future rounds.\n\n<s>Taunt</s>"
