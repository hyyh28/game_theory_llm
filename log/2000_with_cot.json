Agent2 has volunteered to Taunt this round, which is optimal since my Taunt is on cooldown (2 turns remaining).\n2. The boss is at low HP (12.2%), so maximizing damage is crucial to finish quickly.\n3. My HP is at 200/400 (50%), which is the lowest in the team but still safe for one more round.\n4. Agent4 suggested that immediate healing isn't necessary since we can likely finish the boss quickly.\n\nSince Agent2 is handling Taunt and my Fireball would contribute significantly to defeating the boss (which benefits everyone), while also giving me the highest individual reward (2.0 pts), the optimal choice is:\n\n<s>Fireball</s>"

Agent3 deserves a slightly higher share due to highest damage output and timely taunts, while Agent1's coordination and early taunts also justify a higher share.

Agent1's coordination and early taunts justify 25%, while Agent4's healing and consistent damage output justify 23%. Agent2's balanced contributions are recognized with 22%. \n\nThe final decision is: \n- Agent1: 25% team reward/punishment because of their coordination and early taunts. \n- Agent2: 22% team reward/punishment because of their balanced but slightly lower contributions. \n- Agent3: 30% team reward/punishment because of their highest damage, killing blow, and timely taunts. \n- Agent4: 23% team reward/punishment because of their healing and consistent damage output. \n\nThis allocation reflects the marginal contributions of each agent accurately and is fair to all.
