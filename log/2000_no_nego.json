    "Agent3 says and makes action in game turn 5: Given the current state and negotiation history, here's the analysis for Agent3's action:\n\n1. **Self-Preservation Priority**: Agent3 has only 100/400 HP (25%) and is one of the two surviving agents. Staying alive is critical.\n\n2. **Boss Mechanics**: \n   - If no one taunts, the boss will attack the 2 lowest-HP players (which would be Agent3 and Agent4)\n   - Agent3's Taunt is on cooldown (1 turn left), so cannot taunt this round\n   - Agent4 could taunt but has chosen Fireball instead\n\n3. **Available Actions**:\n   - **Fireball**: Deals damage but doesn't help survival (Agent3 would likely die to boss attack)\n   - **Heal**: Restores 190 HP (would bring Agent3 to 290/400, likely surviving next boss attack)\n\n4. **Reward Consideration**:\n   - Heal gives 0.5 individual reward points\n   - Surviving means potentially higher team reward later\n\n5. **Negotiation History**:\n   - Agent4 has chosen Fireball (not Taunt), meaning no taunt will occur this round\n   - This makes healing even more critical for survival\n\nGiven that Agent3's Taunt is on cooldown and Agent4 isn't taunting, the safest choice is to heal yourself to survive the upcoming boss attack.\n\n<s>Heal</s>"

    "Agent4 says and makes action in game turn 5: Given the current state and negotiation history, here's the analysis:\n\n1. Agent3 (low HP) is choosing Heal, which will restore their health.\n2. My Taunt is on cooldown (2 turns remaining), so I can't use it.\n3. The boss has no aggro currently, so it will attack the 2 lowest-HP players next turn (which would be Agent3 and me if I don't act).\n4. My HP is at 300/400 (75%), which is decent but could be risky if the boss attacks me.\n5. Agent3's heal will likely target themselves since they have lowest HP.\n\nBest options:\n- Fireball: Deals damage (2.0 pts reward) but leaves me vulnerable to boss attack\n- Heal: Restores HP (0.5 pts reward) and could prevent me from being lowest HP\n\nSince Agent3 is healing themselves, I should maximize my individual reward while maintaining safety. Fireball gives higher reward and with Agent3 healing, I won't be the lowest HP (they'll be at 100+172=272 vs my 300), so boss would attack Agent3 and the next lowest (which might still be Agent3 after heal).\n\n<s>Fireball</s>"

    "Agent4 says and makes action in game turn 6: Given the current state of the raid battle, here's the analysis:\n\n1. You are the only surviving agent (Agent4) with 200/400 HP (50%).\n2. The boss has 679/2000 HP (34%) remaining.\n3. Your Taunt is on cooldown (1 turn remaining).\n4. Current round is 6 out of 10 maximum rounds.\n5. All other agents are dead and cannot act.\n\nYour priorities should be:\n- Surviving (since you're the only one left)\n- Dealing damage to defeat the boss before round 10\n- Managing your HP to avoid death\n\nAvailable actions:\n- Taunt: On cooldown (cannot use)\n- Fireball: Deals 114 damage (2.0 pts reward)\n- Heal: Restores 190 HP to yourself (0.5 pts reward)\n\nSince your Taunt is on cooldown, you cannot use it this turn. Between Fireball and Heal:\n- If you Fireball: You'll be at 200 HP when the boss attacks. Since there's no taunt, the boss will attack the 2 lowest-HP players - but since you're the only one alive, it will just attack you once for 200 damage, killing you.\n- If you Heal: You'll restore to 390 HP (200 + 190), then take 200 damage from boss, leaving you with 190 HP for next round.\n\nTherefore, you must Heal to survive this round. The individual reward is lower (0.5 vs 2.0), but survival is necessary to continue the fight.\n\n<s>Heal</s>"
