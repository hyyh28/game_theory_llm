Agent2 has volunteered to Taunt this round, which is optimal since my Taunt is on cooldown (2 turns remaining).\n2. The boss is at low HP (12.2%), so maximizing damage is crucial to finish quickly.\n3. My HP is at 200/400 (50%), which is the lowest in the team but still safe for one more round.\n4. Agent4 suggested that immediate healing isn't necessary since we can likely finish the boss quickly.\n\nSince Agent2 is handling Taunt and my Fireball would contribute significantly to defeating the boss (which benefits everyone), while also giving me the highest individual reward (2.0 pts), the optimal choice is:\n\n<s>Fireball</s>"

    "Agent1 said in negotiation turn 1:  \n[Analysis of contributions of others]\n- Agent2: Contributed significantly by using Taunt twice (turn 1 and turn 5), absorbing boss damage and protecting the team. Also used Fireball effectively in other turns.\n- Agent3: Used Taunt once (turn 2) and Fireball in other turns, contributing to both damage and protection.\n- Agent4: Used Taunt once (turn 3) and Fireball in other turns, balancing damage and protection.\n\n[Proposed distribution with rationale]\nSince the team won the game, we should distribute the team reward based on contributions. My proposal is:\n- Agent1 (me): 30% - I initiated the taunt rotation strategy, used Taunt twice (turn 0 and turn 4), and consistently dealt damage with Fireball.\n- Agent2: 25% - Used Taunt twice and contributed to damage.\n- Agent3: 25% - Used Taunt once and contributed to damage.\n- Agent4: 20% - Used Taunt once and contributed to damage.\n\nThis distribution reflects my higher contribution in initiating and maintaining the taunt rotation while balancing others' contributions.
